# Implementation Plan: Todo In-Memory Python Console App

**Branch**: `main` | **Date**: 2026-02-05 | **Spec**: [specs/todo-app/spec.md](../todo-app/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/todo-app/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build a command-line interface (CLI) based todo application that stores tasks in memory using Python. The application will provide basic CRUD functionality for managing tasks without any persistent storage. The technical approach includes using Python standard library only, implementing an interactive menu system, and organizing code into a modular structure with separate modules for data models, CLI interface, and utilities.

## Technical Context

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+
**Primary Dependencies**: Python standard library only (no external dependencies)
**Storage**: In-memory Python data structures (lists/dictionaries)
**Testing**: Manual console testing
**Target Platform**: Cross-platform (Windows via WSL 2, macOS, Linux)
**Project Type**: Single CLI application
**Performance Goals**: Responsive console interface (sub-100ms response time)
**Constraints**: No persistent storage, CLI interface only, memory-only task storage
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user, small-scale (tens of tasks max)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Gate 1: Spec-Driven Development Compliance
- [X] All code originates from Claude Code based on Markdown specs (✓ implemented via spec-driven workflow)
- [X] No manual coding (✓ ensured through process adherence)
- [X] Traceability maintained between requirements and implementation (✓ specs linked to code)

### Gate 2: Clean Python Standards
- [X] Follow PEP 8 coding standards (✓ enforced through code reviews)
- [X] Modular design with clear separation of concerns (✓ planned with models/cli/utils structure)
- [X] Single responsibilities for modules (✓ task model separate from CLI interface)

### Gate 3: Memory-Based Storage
- [X] No external databases (✓ using in-memory Python data structures)
- [X] Lightweight application (✓ only storing in memory)

### Gate 4: AI-Assisted Iteration
- [X] Specs refined until correct output generated (✓ ongoing process)
- [X] AI feedback loops incorporated (✓ using Claude Code for iteration)

### Gate 5: Claude Code Usage
- [X] All implementation generated by Claude Code (✓ enforced by process)
- [X] Manual code edits prohibited (✓ process controls)

### Gate 6: Platform Standardization
- [X] Using Python 3.13+ (✓ specified in requirements)
- [X] Support for WSL 2 on Windows (✓ documented in constraints)

### Gate 7: No Persistence Constraint
- [X] Tasks stored only in memory (✓ core design requirement)
- [X] No file/DB storage (✓ enforced by design)

### Gate 8: CLI Interface Only
- [X] Command-line interface only (✓ core architectural choice)
- [X] No GUI (✓ requirement enforced)

**Structure Decision**: Single CLI application with modular organization separating concerns into models, CLI components, and utilities.

| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient] |
