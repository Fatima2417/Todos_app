# Todo In-Memory Python Console App Constitution

## Core Principles

### Spec-Driven Development (SDD) First
All code must originate from Claude Code based on Markdown specs. No manual coding allowed. This ensures traceability, reduces defects, and maintains alignment between requirements and implementation.

### Clean & Structured Python
Follow PEP 8, modular design, and clear separation of concerns. Code must be readable, maintainable, and follow Python best practices. Modules should have single responsibilities and clear interfaces.

### Memory-Based Storage
No external databases—store tasks in Python data structures during runtime. This keeps the application lightweight and focused on core functionality without persistence overhead.

### AI-Assisted Iteration
Refine specs until Claude Code produces correct, functional output. Leverage AI feedback loops to continuously improve both specifications and implementations through iterative refinement.

### Claude Code Usage Mandate
All implementation must be generated by Claude Code. Manual code edits are prohibited. This ensures consistent, spec-compliant code generation and maintains the integrity of the SDD process.

### Platform Standardization
Use Python 3.13+ with UV package manager. Windows users must use WSL 2 with Ubuntu 22.04. This creates consistent development environments and eliminates platform-specific issues.

## Additional Constraints

**No Persistence**: Tasks are stored only in memory (no file/DB storage). Application state is ephemeral and resets on restart.

**Command-Line Interface Only**: No GUI allowed. Focus on console-based interaction for simplicity and platform independence.

**Project Structure**: Maintain /src/ for Python source code, /specs/ for all specifications, with README.md and CLAUDE.md for documentation.

## Development Workflow

**Specification Requirement**: Each feature requires a Markdown spec in /specs/features/. No implementation without a corresponding spec document.

**Testing Mandate**: Console app must demonstrably work for all five Basic Level features: Add Task, Delete Task, Update Task, View Task List, Mark as Complete/Incomplete.

**Quality Gates**: All implementations must run without errors in console and meet the specified success criteria before approval.

## Governance

This constitution supersedes all other development practices. All code contributions must comply with these principles. Amendments require formal documentation and team approval. All pull requests and reviews must verify constitution compliance. This document serves as the definitive authority for development standards and practices.
