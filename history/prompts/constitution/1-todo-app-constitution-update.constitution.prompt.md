# Prompt History Record

## Summary
Created initial constitution for Todo In-Memory Python Console App with core principles and governance structure.

## Original Prompt
```
Project: Todo In-Memory Python Console App (Phase I)

Core Principles:

Spec-Driven Development (SDD) First: All code must originate from Claude Code based on Markdown specs. No manual coding allowed.

Clean & Structured Python: Follow PEP 8, modular design, and clear separation of concerns.

Memory-Based Storage: No external databases—store tasks in Python data structures during runtime.

AI-Assisted Iteration: Refine specs until Claude Code produces correct, functional output.

Key Standards:

Specification Files: Each feature requires a Markdown spec in /specs/features/.

Claude Code Usage: All implementation must be generated by Claude Code. Manual code edits are prohibited.

Project Structure:

/src/ for Python source code

/specs/ for all specifications

README.md with setup instructions

CLAUDE.md with instructions for Claude Code

Testing: Console app must demonstrably work for all five Basic Level features.

Constraints:

Platform: Python 3.13+ with UV

Environment: Windows users must use WSL 2 with Ubuntu 22.04

No Persistence: Tasks are stored only in memory (no file/DB storage)

No GUI: Command-line interface only

Success Criteria:

All five Basic Level features fully functional:

Add Task
Delete Task
Update Task
View Task List
Mark as Complete/Incomplete
Spec-driven workflow demonstrated in /specs/ history

Repository includes all required deliverables

App runs without errors in console
```

## Response
Created the constitution file at .specify/memory/constitution.md with all the specified principles and constraints. The constitution includes:
- Core principles: SDD First, Clean Python, Memory Storage, AI-Assisted Iteration, Claude Code Usage, Platform Standardization
- Additional constraints: No persistence, CLI only, project structure requirements
- Development workflow: Specification requirement, testing mandate, quality gates
- Governance: Authority and amendment procedures
- Version 1.0.0 with proper ratification and amendment dates
